                "Because Stanford is a non-profit, the Elan apartment complex will contribute less or perhaps nothing to the city, county, local schools and other agencies that receive property taxes. For the city, the hit will be about $100,000 a year. Its impact on the schools wasn’t immediately available.\n" +
                "Stanford in a statement said it will work with both Redwood City School District and Sequoia Union High School District on ways to “expand opportunities for students and educators.”\n" +
                "Redwood City School District decided to close four schools last November due to shrinking enrollment, which led to decreased funds. The school district receives money from the state based on the number of students enrolled and how many show up to class.\n" +
                "City Manager Melissa Stevenson-Diaz told the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors in September that the city could lose up to $100,000 yearly in tax revenues if the building is taken off the property tax rolls.\n" +
                "Stanford is offering 138 of the apartments to Stanford employees or students. The other 37 apartments will be deed-restricted for people who earn between 50% and 80% of the area’s median income. That means a family of four who earns between $80,600 and $129,150 a year can apply to live in one of the 37 apartments.\n" +
                "Since the project is about a 10-minute walk from the Redwood City Caltrain Station, Stanford intends to have most of its tenants walk to the Caltrain station to catch the train to Palo Alto, or take the shuttle to Stanford’s 35-acre campus at Douglas Avenue and Bay Road. When Stanford built its Redwood City campus, it provided no additional housing.\n" +
                "Stanford has already re-named the apartment complex at 1 Franklin Street from Elan Redwood City to The Cardinal Apartments.\n" +
                "This isn’t the first time Stanford has purchased an apartment complex off campus. In 2015, Stanford bought a 167-unit apartment complex called The Colonnade at 4750 El Camino Real in Los Altos, across the street from the San Antonio Shopping Center.\n" +
                "“It did represent a significant impact on our city,” Los Altos City Council member Anita Enander told the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors in September. “Not only did that take $60 million of assessed valuation off of the books to affect our city’s taxes and our schools, but that in fact, Stanford has in excess of $100 million of property in the little tiny city of Los Altos that is exempt on the tax roll.”\n" +
                "Enander’s testimony came during hearings the county was holding on Stanford’s request for a permit to build 3.5 million square feet.\n" +
                "Stanford later withdrew its request for the permit four days before the supervisors were to decide how the university should mitigate the impact of its project on housing, traffic and other concerns.\n" +
                "While Stanford has withdrawn the permit application, it continues to build 215 apartments and office space at 500 El Camino Real in Menlo Park and is seeking permission to build 27 homes and 12 apartments near the Alpine Inn in Portola Valley.\n" +
                "Stanford is also buying up single-family homes. Palo Altan Pria Graves, the College Terrace Residents’ Association’s Stanford Observer, said in a Post guest opinion piece last year that the university had purchased 30 homes.\n" +

                "In all, the top ten entities own nearly $59.2 billion ($59,153,247,282) worth of taxable property, both secured and unsecured, between them.\n" +
                "That analysis is the result of a year-long project from a team of reporters from NBC Bay Area, Telemundo 48/Area de la Bahia, The San Jose Mercury News, KQED and REVEAL from The Center for Investigative Reporting which examined in depth roughly 500,000 property records on file at Santa Clara County’s Property Assessor’s Office.\n" +
                "According to the 2018 Assessor’s property records there were 500,593 secured parcels and 149,863 unsecured parcels with a taxable value of $519,180,026,350.\n" +
                "Talking about the taxable value of all this property, Santa Clara Property Assessor Larry Stone, in office since 1994, says “it's gone from a modest $15 billion to $516 ($519) billion in 24 years. Now, I would guess that the market value of all of that property would probably be a trillion and a half dollars.”\n" +
                "TOP LANDOWNERS\n" +
                "The top ten landowners are led by an organization that first began purchasing land here in the 1880’s, the descendants of Leland Stanford and his namesake legacy, Stanford University.\n" +
                "According to the team’s analysis of the publicly available property records, Stanford owns more in property value than organizations listed from No. 5 through No. 10 combined. Stanford’s property value: at least $19.7 billion($19,749,955,770).\n" +
                "The next two major property owners are relatively recent to Silicon Valley: Apple, Inc., founded in 1976 with property valued at nearly $9 billion ($8,969,175,980) and Google, Inc, founded in 1998, with property valued at $7.5 billion ($7,504,656,526).\n" +
                "A BOOM WITH A DOWNSIDE\n" +
                "Further analysis shows that like Apple and Google, much of this land ownership has taken place relatively recently, including during the second wave of the tech boom following the 2008 recession.\n" +
                "While the growth of the gig economy has meant many tech workers have become rich and employment has exceeded just about every other community in the country, the team’s investigation found all this wealth leaves behind thousands of working class residents who don’t work in high tech or make similar high salaries.\n" +
                "To see the recent boom in job growth in the tech sector compared to a similar rise in median home prices and rent, pricing out middle class and low-income wage earners, look at the charts below taken from data available on Zillow and California’s Employment Development Department (EDD).\n" +
                "Included among the residents left behind are folks like Felix Diaz, his wife, Mariel and their two children.\n" +
                "“It's hard to live in this economy,” Diaz told NBC Bay Area.\n" +
                "A janitor at NASA Ames, Diaz and his family had to fight to stay in the apartment they’ve rented for eleven years after the complex was sold. Diaz told NBC Bay Area that the new owners, who he’s never met, tried to raise the rent and prompted some of their long-time neighbors to leave.\n" +
                "“After three or four months (of ownership) they started doing things like try and, like, evict us,” Diaz said. “We knew the previous owner because he was always here.”\n" +
                "Because Diaz asserted his rights as a renter under local rent control protections he and his family were able to stay in the apartments while other residents, he said, simply moved out rather than fight.\n" +
                "Back when he knew the apartment complex’s old owners, Diaz felt he could talk to them about issues and problems and felt secure staying put in his apartment for a long time.\n" +
                "That’s why Diaz now wants to know exactly who owns and controls the apartments where he lives.\n" +
                "“It made us frustrated,” Diaz said.\n" +
                "Using this recent property data, the reporting team found that the new owners of Diaz’s apartment complex include four different entities including a real estate attorney and an LLC making it difficult for him or any resident to go to any one person in case of problems like he did in the past.\n" +
                "NBC Bay Area reached out to the management company that oversees the apartments on behalf of the current owners and asked about the eviction warnings sent to tenants.\n" +
                "An executive at Prodesse Property Group responded in an email stating “since we began managing the property we have had to commence one unlawful detainer action, which resulted in the eviction of one resident for non-payment of rent.”\n" +
                "“We are currently in the process of a second unlawful detainer action, also for non-payment of rent which again is clearly an identified cause to terminate a tenancy under San Jose’s just cause eviction law. If a resident does not pay rent, unfortunately our recourse is to commence the unlawful detainer process, which may then result in the eviction of the resident. We don’t take this step lightly. We follow the laws in place and only commence such actions against a resident when absolutely necessary.”\n" +
                "THE GAP WIDENS\n" +
                "San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo says he recognizes how these huge landowners and the incredible amount of income and property they control as well as the thousands of new jobs they’ve brought to Silicon Valley, while a good thing for the overall economy, also has created a growing chasm between the haves and have-nots.\n" +
                "“It really has become a tale of two valleys,” said Mayor Liccardo. “And we know that for all the prosperity we've seen in this region, it's the envy of the rest of the country. (But) we have thousands and thousands of families who are struggling and falling further behind and being pushed out. And so, we're really at a crossroads in our valley.”\n" +
                "“There's no question that this is all of our problem,” Liccardo said. “And it's all of our responsibility to tackle this affordable housing crisis. The reality is it (the gap between haves and have-nots) has only gotten worse. The problem is, over the last six to seven years, we've seen job growth exceed housing production by a ratio of six to one. And that’s a recipe for disaster.”\n" +
                "Mayor Liccardo and Assessor Stone blame both elected municipal leaders as well as the major companies that have created all these jobs without creating an equal amount of housing to keep up with the job growth.\n" +
                "“I don’t think any major tech company is doing enough to have to deal with the impact they're having on traffic and housing,” Stone said. “I mean, you can see it there (outside.) We’re overrun with traffic. Housing prices are out of control. Even rent prices are out of control. So obviously, the tech companies are not doing enough to mitigate traffic and housing costs impact.”\n" +
                "Former Mountain View Mayor Lenny Siegel places even more blame on local political leaders whom, he says, didn’t require big tech to pay to help provide for more housing and infrastructure when they first came to town.\n" +
                "“Housing development is not keeping up with employment growth,” Siegel said. “Some of the communities around here have a sense of exclusivity. They don't want to have the lower income people living there.”\n" +
                "Siegel says these political decisions made by city councils had an economic basis too.\n" +
                "“Historically it's been cheaper to serve industry than to serve residents,” former mayor Siegel said. “So, industry generates taxes and doesn't demand a lot of police schools that taxpayers have to pay for.”\n" +
                "The result has been that many municipalities have seen the economic benefit of companies moving to town while neighboring cities, primarily San Jose, have had to absorb the population crunch that comes along with the economic boom.\n" +
                "“So, the cities in northern Santa Clara County in particular, historically have emphasized job growth and not residential growth. San Jose was our bedroom community for a long time. It still is,” Siegel said.\n" +
                "But, Siegel says, some cities such as Mountain View and Palo Alto have begun to change their approach.\n" +
                "Palo Alto Mayor Eric Filseth agrees that many elected leaders around the area were slow to address these issues. But Filseth says simple economics and the difficulty in getting middle wage workers to fill public sector jobs changes Palo Alto city leaders’ thinking about five years ago.\n" +
                "“Low and middle wage earners come under a huge amount of pressure. That's certainly happening in our town,” Filseth said.\n" +
                "Because of high housing costs, “less than 10 percent of our teachers live here in Palo Alto. Less than 7 percent of our city staff lives here in Palo Alto,” Mayor Filseth said. “We began taking measures to try to constrain job growth to the point where we could realistically keep up on housing. Since about 2016, that's been the case. But the valley, continues to produce jobs vastly faster than it produces housing.”\n" +
                "FUTURE ROLE WEALTH PLAYS IN SUCCESS OR FAILURE\n" +
                "Which brings us back to all these top ten property owners and all the wealth currently residing in Silicon Valley.\n" +
                "“I see this as fundamentally a problem of investment,” Filseth said. “I mean, the valley has generated immense wealth. The valley's economic expansion has generated immense wealth and has not invested it enough of it in the housing and transportation infrastructure that's necessary to support that expansion.”\n" +
                "Despite some successes Assessor Stone says enough still has been done either by elected leaders or by the major property-owning tech companies and developers.\n" +
                "Stone compares the current Silicon Valley to the metro area around Detroit during the automotive boom of the 1950’s and 60’s.\n" +
                "“You know it (inattention to housing and infrastructure) is going to kill us,” Stone said.\n" +
                "Like Silicon Valley now “everybody wanted to be Detroit. They wanted an automobile industry,” said Stone.\n" +
                "Now said the man who’s been watching this problem from his seat in the Property Assessor’s office for a quarter century warns “Detroit's been in bankruptcy. The population (of Detroit) has gone from 2 million to 600,000. And I truly believe that if we do not solve our housing problem in general, we will eventually go the way of Detroit.”\n" +
                "“And things happen a lot faster here in Silicon Valley than they did in Detroit,” said Stone. “So, if we don't solve these problems, we will go the way of Detroit a lot quicker than Detroit.”\n", "10"));

                "Students were asked to decide whether the video, accompanied by a post that read \"Have you ever noticed that the ONLY people caught committing voter fraud are Democrats?,\" was \"strong evidence\" of voter fraud during the 2016 Democratic primaries.\n" +
                "Over half of the students thought that it was true despite the fact that the video showed voter fraud in Russia, not in the United States. Among all of the students, only three were able to find the original source of the video.\n" +
                "Researchers with the Stanford History Education Group, an effort housed at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, called the results of their study \"troubling\": The inability of students to gauge the credibility and accuracy of online information poses a serious threat to \"the vitality of American democracy.\" \n" +
                "\"The 2020 presidential election is just a year away, and many current high school students will be first-time voters. Our findings show that they are unprepared to assess the information they encounter,\" Professor Sam Wineburg, founder of the Stanford History Education Group, who co-authored the report with the group's director, Joel Breakstone, and Director of Assessment Mark Smith, said in a press release.\n" +
                "The Stanford History Education Group study, conducted with Texas education research group Gibson Consulting, was a follow-up to 2016 research, conducted in the wake of that year's presidential election and the rise of fake news. The earlier research found that students from middle school to college \"struggled to perform even the most basic evaluations of digital material,\" confusing online ads with news stories and trusting a photo posted anonymously on social media.\n" +
                "For the new study, 3,446 high school students from 16 districts across 14 states, including California, evaluated videos, websites, articles and social media claims between June 2018 and May 2019. They were asked to complete six tasks, and the majority of students struggled with all of them, according to the results.\n" +
                "In one task, students were to determine whether a website is a reliable source of information about global warming. They were reminded that they were allowed to search online to answer that question. The few students who performed well on the task searched online to find out that the website is run by the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, a nonprofit organization funded by fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil, that holds a skeptical view of climate change. \n" +
                "More than 96% of students surveyed failed to consider that ties to the fossil fuel industry might affect the credibility of the website, the report states.\n" +
                "In all of the study tasks, researchers were looking for students who used \"lateral reading\" â\u0080\u0094 leaving websites to research their validity elsewhere rather than reading vertically, looking only at the details of a page such as the domain type and the \"about\" page, which are \"easy to manipulate,\" the report states.\n" +
                "The researchers purposely sought out a diverse student sample that would match the demographics of American high school students and allow for an analysis of racial, ethnic, regional and demographic differences. They found that students in urban districts outperformed peers from suburban and rural districts. Students who identified as Asian/Pacific Islander also scored better than their peers, as did students with mothers with higher levels of education. Students who reported receiving free and reduced lunch, marking lower income levels, and those whose families spoke a language other than English at home, did worse than their peers.\n" +
                "\"Our findings suggest that, when it comes to evaluating the quality of digital sources, those most affected are students who have been underserved by our nation's schools,\" the report states. \"Students' socioeconomic status and their ethnicity/race were significant predictors of performance.

March off too slowly — or too far — and you’ll only annoy your companions, who likewise skipped breakfast to save room for the banquet. \n" +
                "Scientists have only recently begun to explore the emotional and social effects of acute hunger. (University ethics boards look unfavorably on experiments that would starve groups of undergraduates in the name of psychology.) But they already know a thing or two. For instance, numerous studies have shown that a low blood glucose level — i.e. hunger — is associated with signs of aggression, a state of mood known as “hangry.”\n" +
                "Hangriness is a distinct sensation of urgency and growing impatience, familiar to anyone who has waited in a long line at a cafeteria or restaurant, or stood among young children running on empty. But there are many flavors of anger, and psychologists are now trying to parse how, exactly, “hanger” differs from the furious, simmering or righteous varieties.\n" +
                "In a recent series of experiments, Jennifer K. MacCormack, a doctoral candidate in psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found that people describe themselves, when hungry, as more annoyed than usual and less in control of their emotions. But that behavior arose only in specific circumstances, and only in comparison to peers who had recently eaten, Ms. MacCormack found.\n" +
                "In one study, she tested the patience of more than 230 hungry student participants by deliberately but discreetly crashing their computers when they were in the middle of a tedious task. That frustration alone was not enough to get a rise out of the hungry students. Ms. MacCormack had divided the subjects into two groups, one that focused on their emotional state as they worked on the computer and another that did not. Only the individuals in the second group, presumably less self-aware of their growing agitation, showed clear signs of stress and annoyance when the computer crashed.\n" +
                "“Being hungry clearly does change our affect, our emotional state,” Ms. MacCormack said. “But this evidence suggests that it does not automatically lead to being angry or more selfish.”\n" +
                "A recent series of experiments, led by Jan Hausser of Justus-Liebig-University in Germany and Nadira Faber of the University of Oxford, reached a similar conclusion. The researchers found that acutely hungry college students were as generous toward strangers as sated ones were. In one experiment, 51 students who had not eaten in 14 hours participated in so-called cooperation games, which digitally simulated joint investment decisions and rated the selfishness of those decisions. The students were famished, by their own reports, and measures of their blood glucose levels confirmed as much.\n" +
                "But they were just as generous in the cooperation tests as 51 peers who had arrived at the lab well fed, the study found. The researchers then tested the results in the real world. They recruited more than 600 participants at a cafeteria, half before they had eaten and the other half after lunch. Each participant was given either money (10 euros) or food (packets of dried fruit and nuts) and soon after was approached by a stranger, discreetly working with the research team, with a request: “Could you spare some change, or something to eat? I’m hungry.”\n" +
                "The famished students shared just as much of their money or food as the students who had just eaten, the study revealed. “We found that this big sensation of hunger did not affect how prosocial and cooperative these students were,” said Paul A.M. Van Lange, a psychologist at VU Amsterdam and an author of the study.\n" +
                "In effect, he and Ms. MacCormack argue, the social generosity of humans appears to be sufficiently deep-seated and potent to trump the irritation of an empty stomach, at least of the affluent Western variety. “One thing this research suggests to me is that, deep down, we humans may be more prosocial than we think we are” when short on resources, Dr. Van Lange said.\n" +
                "Michael Bang Petersen, a political scientist at Aarhus University in Denmark, has found, similarly, that hungry people are just as likely to endorse generous social programs as are individuals who have eaten recently. \n" +
                "“The common wisdom is that being hungry makes people irritable, and that of course has some basis in fact,” Dr. Petersen said. “The problem facing us currently is to understand how we can have these feelings of increased irritability and a perception that we lack of self-control, and yet often do not act that way.” Hunger doesn’t drastically change our behavior, but we think that it does — why?\n" +
                "Posing all of this to a tipsy, sarcastic uncle with pumpkin on his shirt may not be a recipe for holiday peace. But by then hunger can be no excuse, and there’s always the option of the post-meal evening walk, this time for digestion.\n", "4"));

                "But some researchers suspect meal timing matters as well. Working muscles need fuel during exercise, mostly in the form of sugar (glucose) or fat. That fuel can come from our most recent meal, once its component sugars and fats reach our bloodstreams, or from our bodies’ stores of fats and sugars. We all have such stores, especially of fat, some of it residing in our muscles and marbling them like pricey sirloin.\n" +
                "This muscle fat becomes problematic if we accumulate too much of it. Fatty muscles do not respond well to the hormone insulin, which directs sugar from the blood into the muscles. As a result, excess fat can contribute to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels and increased risks for Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions.\n" +
                "So, researchers at the University of Bath in England and other institutions began to wonder whether meal timing might influence how much muscle fat we burn during exercise, which would then affect the long-term metabolic consequences of exercise and help to explain, in part, why some people get more out of exercise than others.\n" +
                "To look into those issues, they recruited 30 overweight, sedentary men. (They plan to do a follow-up study with women.) The researchers tested the men’s fitness and insulin sensitivity and then divided them into three groups.\n" +
                "One, as a control, continued their usual lives. The other two groups started supervised exercise in the morning three times a week, riding stationary bicycles at a moderate pace while wearing monitors and masks that tracked their heart rates and the amount of fat and sugar they burned. The researchers also asked them periodically how they felt while riding.\n" +
                "One exercise group also downed a vanilla-flavored shake two hours before their ride (with no other breakfast) while the other group swallowed a similar-tasting placebo drink, containing water, flavoring and no calories. In other words, the placebo group rode on an empty stomach, but did not know it.\n" +
                "After exercise, each rider received the drink he had not previously swallowed. The riders who had fasted got the shake and the other group the placebo.\n" +
                "This routine continued for six weeks. Afterward, the scientists crunched numbers and turned up some telling differences between the groups. As expected, the control group’s fitness and insulin sensitivity remained unbudged, while the men in both exercise groups had improved their fitness and narrowed their waistlines, although few had lost weight.\n" +
                "The riders who had pedaled on an empty stomach, however, had incinerated about twice as much fat during each ride as the men who consumed the shake first. The riders all had burned about the same number of calories while pedaling, but more of those calories came from fat when the men did not eat first.\n" +
                "Those riders also showed greater improvements in insulin sensitivity at the end of the study and had developed higher levels of certain proteins in their muscles that influence how well muscle cells respond to insulin and use blood sugar.\n" +
                "On the whole, these findings suggest that “you can probably get more out of your workout without increasing its intensity or duration by exercising before breakfast,” says Javier Gonzalez, a professor of physiology and nutrition at the University of Bath, who oversaw the new study, which appeared in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.\n" +
                "The reasons for this extra metabolic boost are complex but most likely involve slimming of muscle fat, he says. The fasted riders’ bodies had to turn to internal energy stores for fuel, including fat from their muscles. (Interestingly, the fasted riders did not feel as if their workouts were more draining than the other group, according to everyone’s subjective ratings of their exertions.)\n" +
                "This study looked primarily at insulin sensitivity, though, and not other aspects of exercise and metabolism, including weight loss. (Other research by some of the same investigators have looked at how eating before exercise may affect appetite.) The researchers also cannot tell whether skipping lunch before an early-evening workout would have the same effects, although it seems likely, Dr. Gonzalez says.\n" +
                "“We believe that the key is the fasting period, rather than the time of day,” he says.\n" +
                "So, if you hope to use exercise to keep you healthy in the coming holiday period, you might try to get up and out early or after not eating for hours. But, Dr. Gonzalez says, if your schedule or preferences prevent you from exercising in the morning or on an empty stomach, do not sweat it.\n" +

Her leg had been amputated after a long-ago knee replacement became infected; she also suffered from diabetes, depression, anxiety and general muscular weakness.\n" +
                "An occupational therapist named Susan Nielson began working with her an hour a day, five days a week. Gradually, the patient became more mobile. With assistance and encouragement, she could transfer from her bed to a wheelchair, get herself to the bathroom for personal grooming and lift light weights to build her endurance.\n" +
                "That progress ended abruptly on Oct. 1, when Medicare changed its payment system for physical, occupational and speech therapy in nursing homes. Ms. Nielson, employed by Reliant Rehabilitation, which supplies therapists to almost 900 nursing facilities, said that her allotted time with the woman was reduced from 60 minutes to just 20 or so minutes a day, not even long enough to help her leave her bed.\n" +
                "“I’m not able to do my job,” Ms. Nielson said. “This person had the potential to do more, and I couldn’t help her.”\n" +
                "The same lament is being expressed by therapists nationwide. Professional organizations, including the American Physical Therapy Association and theAmerican Occupational Therapy Association, report that the new Medicare policy has prompted some nursing home chains and rehab companies to scale back the treatment they provide to patients, and to lay off therapists or switch them to part-time status.\n" +
                "The organizations’ members are also speaking out about the pressure they feel to conduct therapy in groups rather than one-on-one. Medicare allows up to 25 percent of patients’ therapy to take place in groups — and some employers reportedly began requiring that percentage on Oct. 1, whether therapists thought their patients would benefit or not.\n" +
                "“Patients’ needs didn’t change overnight,” said Kara Gainer, director of regulatory affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association. “So what changed?” Although some companies have reacted responsibly to the new system, she said, “some are bad actors who put profits before patients.”\n" +
                "Her members have responded with “concern, fear, outrage,” she added. A new Facebook group, Rehab Therapists for a Union, swiftly attracted more than 20,000 members. A petition on Change.org, asking the Department of Health and Human Services to intervene, garnered 80,000 signatures.\n" +
                "Before Oct. 1, Medicare reimbursed nursing homes for therapy based on the number of minutes provided to each patient, up to 720 minutes a week. The goal is to help patients regain mobility and the ability to perform daily tasks, so that they can safely return home.\n" +
                "For years, however, federal investigators and advisers have reported that nursing homes frequently provided the maximum number of minutes of therapy, regardless of whether patients needed that much treatment.\n" +
                "“Therapy was sort of a profit center,” said Sharmila Sandhu, who directs regulatory affairs at the American Occupational Therapy Association. “The more therapy, the higher the reimbursement.”\n" +
                "The new approach, called the Patient-Driven Payment Model, eliminates such incentives; now facilities are paid based on patients’ diagnoses and characteristics. In an email, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called the P.D.P.M. “a historic reform” that will “appropriately reflect each resident’s actual care needs.”\n" +
                "“This is a well-intended policy, a real sea change in how we pay for care,” said David Grabowski, a health care policy researcher at Harvard Medical School who is organizing a study of the policy’s effects.\n" +
                "But about 70 percent of the nation’s 15,000 or so nursing homes are for-profit and have proved adept at maintaining profit margins despite policy shifts, said Toby Edelman, senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.\n" +
                "Without volume incentives, nursing homes may direct therapists to administer less therapy and to see patients in groups, reducing the number of professionals required and lowering labor costs.\n" +
                "“The risk before was overprovision of therapy,” Dr. Grabowski said. “Now the real concern is underprovision.”\n" +
                "Genesis HealthCare, one of the country’s largest providers of skilled nursing, has eliminated about 500 therapist positions since the Patient-Driven Payment Model took effect. “We have found that the appropriate use of group and concurrent therapy can actually be more efficacious than one-on-one therapy in many cases,” a spokesman for the company said in an email.\n" +
                "Maybe. A number of studies have shown that group therapy (in which several patients work on the same task) or concurrent therapy (where the patients work on different tasks) can indeed be helpful. But therapists have insisted that their clinical judgments, not the dictates of employers, should determine who gets what kind of therapy, and how much.\n" +
                "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services acknowledged as much in its final rule adopting P.D.P.M.: “We agree that therapists are the most appropriate professionals to determine the mode of therapy a patient should receive and that professional judgment must be trusted and used” in nursing facilities.\n" +
                "Therapists contend that, instead, their judgments are being overridden. Alexander Zwick, a physical therapist at JDT Villa, a rehab facility in Lincoln Park, N.J., said that after Sept. 30, patients “were getting less therapy because people on the business side were coming between patients and professionals.”\n" +
                "“The time for the patients dropped drastically,” Mr. Zwick said, from an hour a day to 30 to 45 minutes: “Same patients, same diagnoses, different payment system.” (JDT declined to comment.)\n" +
                "Therapists have also reported that, where facilities have substantially reduced staffing, the workload of the remaining workers has become unmanageable.\n" +
                "Medicare officials have repeatedly said they will monitor the new system. “Significant changes in the amount of therapy provided” or “the manner in which it is delivered” could trigger reviews and policy changes, a Medicare spokesman said in an email.\n" +
                "Nursing facilities already face potential financial penalties, as well as lowered ratings on Medicare’s Nursing Home Compare website, if they perform poorly on certain outcomes. For instance, Ms. Nielson said that her patient developed a pressure ulcer, or bed sore, and was readmitted to the hospital; that will show up on annual surveys.\n" +
                "(In an email, a spokesman for Reliant Rehabilitation said that the company had “provided guideposts for care management under P.D.P.M.” and had trained therapists in the benefits of group therapy. “We encourage them to use their clinical judgment to determine when it is appropriate.”)\n" +
                "Perhaps, if quality measures don’t reveal problems, patients didn’t actually benefit from all the therapy previously provided at great expense. Nursing home surveys might indicate that patients fare just as well under the new system.\n" +
                "But some consequences don’t show up on surveys. Consider a patient Mr. Zwick was working with, an 89-year-old woman with heart failure. “She was motivated,” he said. “She wanted to get home. She had a wedding to attend.”\n" +
                "Suppose, after her discharge, she couldn’t walk “household distances” or use the toilet independently because he’d been instructed to shorten her therapy sessions from 60 to 45 minutes a day — what would happen to her?\n" +
                "Even if she managed to avoid a fall or re-hospitalization — the kind of red-flag events that attract Medicare’s attention — her quality of life could suffer. She might need to pay out of pocket for home care; the burden on family caregivers might increase.\n" +
                "Mr. Zwick, unable to stomach such prospects, resigned last month to work for a nonprofit home care agency. But he may encounter some of the same issues there. On Jan. 1, Medicare is instituting a similar new reimbursement system for health care and therapy at home.\n", "7"));

                "Kerry: Because it’s only by getting people to buy in and recognize the upside options that you’re going to change the other narrative. We’re trapped right now. And so how do you break out of that trap? I believe you break out of that trap by having conversations with people and motivating people to activate themselves … so that it becomes an actionable belief taken into elections and into boardrooms and into stockholder meetings and into the halls of Congress.\n" +
                "Meyer: What’s the biggest part of that trap—is it partisan?\n" +
                "Kerry: No, it’s not partisan. It’s not partisan. The biggest part of it is simply that you’re getting people to believe sufficiently that they can make a difference by working the democracy, and that they are investing in getting the job done.\n" +
                "That means you are ultimately gonna politicize yourself. You’re going to become involved in that system, and you’re going to go out, and most importantly, you’re going to vote your future. We’re not going to tell them who to vote for. We’re not going to back candidates, but we’re going to try to generate enough energy that people are interested in making sure that they get the job done here.  \n" +
                "Meyer: It seems like on the one hand, you’re not backing candidates, and you’re saying climate change isn’t partisan. On the other hand, this is a very specific set of Republicans that you’ve brought together, and they don’t seem like the rising force in the Republican Party right now. Do you really think this is not a partisan issue?\n" +
                "Kerry: I don’t think it’s a partisan issue. I think it’s been made an ideological issue by some people. But I believe that the vast majority of Americans want to deal with facts, and they want to deal with reality. And if they’re presented with that over a period of time, by people who they know are trustworthy and thoughtful and experienced, I believe we will change the conversation.\n" +
                "Meyer: We’re talking about folks eventually voting on this issue. Do you think the survival of the Paris Agreement rests on the 2020 U.S. election?\n" +
                "Kerry: [Pause.] Um, the reason I’m hesitating is that the president, I believe by executive order, has the right to say that he is going to take the government out.\n" +
                "Meyer: Yes.\n" +
                "Kerry: But something extraordinary is happening in America, which is that states have passed renewable-portfolio laws, and so you’ve got [37] states in our country that are locked in already to moving towards Paris, no matter what the president does. You also have the mayor of every major city in America signed on to the mayor’s commitment to try to live by the Paris Agreement. So you have this dichotomy in America, where the president of the United States has said I’m out, but, frankly, the majority of the American people are still saying, We’re in.\n" +
                "Meyer: Do you think that dichotomy is powerful enough to counteract the U.S. leaving?\n" +
                "Kerry: No. It’s not counter enough; it’s not powerful enough. It’s powerful enough to continue to mitigate to some degree. But ultimately, not having a president committed to this is going to be a disaster globally. We’re losing the momentum, and actors in the world are using the American absence and lack of commitment as an excuse to cover for their desire not really to rush themselves. We saw this in the negotiations in Poland.\n" +
                "Meyer: I think that’s what I mean here, in that we’re seeing other countries hiding behind the U.S. withdrawal.\n" +
                "Kerry: Correct.\n" +
                "Meyer: And if that withdrawal then extends another four years …\n" +
                "Kerry: If it extends another four years, it’s catastrophic for the notion that we’re going to somehow meet this challenge—with one exception. If Big Finance, Big Business, says we’re going to move no matter what, we’re going to do this, that could save the day, actually. But absent that, the lack of a president being committed to this is catastrophic.\n" +
                "Meyer: It’s funny; I was remembering a press conference you gave back during the Paris negotiations, where you said that the Paris Agreement was “a signal to global markets.”\n" +
                "Kerry: Correct. And for the first year, Rob, that worked. For the first year, about $358 billion went into renewables. It was the first time that more money went to renewable than fossil fuel ever. So it worked.\n" +
                "Meyer: Is it continuing?\n" +
                "Kerry: It continued for about two years, and now it’s slacked off. There’s a lot of investment still, but it’s not at the level that it needs to be or we anticipated, or that you would have if you had a president who was really screaming about this.\n" +
                "Meyer: Do you think the Paris Agreement has worked as anticipated?\n" +
                "Kerry: Not as anticipated, because of the interference of our president—I mean, the fact that the president pulled out hugely stemmed the momentum. And that’s another reason for our creating World War Zero. Unless we get this thing on a kind of presidential-leadership, wartime footing, it’s going to be very difficult to meet the goals.\n" +
                "Meyer: This is a bit forward-looking, but let’s say the winning candidate in 2020 wants to do something about climate change. How should America then rebuild its credibility on Paris or on climate? Should it immediately rejoin? Or should it try to set some goals first and show the world it’s serious?\n" +
                "Kerry: Well, I think every presidential candidate has already said that they’re committed to rejoining Paris. So the answer is yeah, they should say we’re going to rejoin.\n" +
                "But I think that we have to leverage immediately the raising of ambition by everybody. And that requires remarkable presidential leadership. You’re going to need to sit down and negotiate with countries. We’re going to have to put real money on the table together with other countries that can afford it.\n" +
                "I mean, basically, the [Group of 20] has the ability to really solve the problem. The fact that the G20 could only put $20 million on the table for the Amazon fire is a disgrace. They’ve never really fully funded the Green Climate Fund. So there’s a lot of work to be done.\n" +
                "But I think if a president came along and immediately began to do those things … it’s doable. That’s what’s so exasperating about this. It is doable, but you don’t see a very specific set of proposals for how you do it. For instance, bringing the auto manufacturers into the White House and sitting them down and saying: “Okay, we’ve got to move this faster. I want to know what the hurdles are. I want to know how we take them out of your way. I want to know what kind of incentives we’re going to need for people to be able to afford to buy the electric car.” Then you’ve got to bring the utility people in.\n" +
                "Meyer: That’s the kind of wartime footing you’re imagining, this mobilization of the private sector.\n" +
                "Kerry: That is precisely what it is. People will competitively protect themselves if it’s simply left up to the outside process. But if, on the other hand, the president is enlisting everybody in this endeavor, then you’ve got the opportunity to eliminate those kinds of hurdles, and people join up, and boom! You’ve got the kind of energy that’s really going to get the job done.\n" +
                "I don’t doubt America’s ability to do that for an instant, but clearly it’s not going to happen with this—with where we are today. But World War Zero is not going to be talking about Trump. This is the first mention you’ve heard me say, and I’m saying, we’re not going to talk about it. We’re not focused on candidates. We’re focused on the ideas and on what has to happen.\n" +
                "Meyer: What’s the best thing that’s happened on climate that you didn’t anticipate, since your last day as secretary of state?\n" +
                "Kerry: I can’t say I didn’t anticipate it, but I think the best thing that’s happened is the reduction in the price of solar and wind. It’s been what we did predict, but it’s the best thing that has happened in terms of the technical, physical component of meeting the challenge.\n" +
                "The best thing that has happened—beyond the technical component of it—is the engagement of young people on a global basis, the fact that they’re kicking butt out there, going out there and trying to hold people accountable. Ultimately, I think that will translate into the kind of political accountability that existed back in 1970, when the Dirty Dozen were held accountable.\n" +
                "Meyer: What’s the worst thing that’s happened?\n" +
                "Kerry: The worst thing is the fact that the largest nations have reneged on genuine efforts to really get there and are playing a game—a very dangerous game—with it. The fact that emissions are going up in the United States, they’re going up in Europe, they’re going up in China, they’re going up in India, they’re going up in countless countries in the world, that is just—I could use an expletive, but it’s really unacceptable. It’s outrageous.\n" +
                "Meyer: You’re welcome to use an expletive.\n" +
                "Kerry: You know, suffice it to say that it’s … outrageously unacceptable. It’s just disgraceful. And the public ultimately is going to catch up and hold people accountable for this kind of indifference.\n" +
                "Meyer: So I have to ask. You were the 68th secretary of state. There have been two since you. Right now, the president is attacking members of the Foreign Service and State Department career employees. If you were in Secretary Mike Pompeo’s shoes, with your boss, the president, attacking your employees, what would you do?\n" +
                "Kerry: Well, I’m not going to get into that. I can’t—I’m not going to get into the politics, which is what it is, of the current administration. I’m trying to build an organization here that is going to be bipartisan and bring people together, not split them apart.\n" +
                "Meyer: Did you work with any of the witnesses?\n" +
                "Kerry: Suffice it to say—Yes, I did work with them, Marie Yovanovitch and many others, David Hale, all these people. But I do want to say how proud I was of those who testified and their courage in defining the best of foreign policy and the best of Foreign Service, and I think America should be very grateful that we have public servants like that.\n" +
                "Meyer: You were the last candidate who tried to unseat a Republican president in a midterm. I realize you’re trying to build a bipartisan organization now, but do you have advice for the current set of candidates who have the same aspiration?\n" +
                "Kerry: I don’t have anything to say about the presidential thing this morning. I mean, that’s not just what I’m involved in right now. I may some time in the future, but I’m not today.\n" +
                "Meyer: What’s the next step for World War Zero?\n" +
                "Kerry: The first thing [people] should do is go to WorldWarZero.com, enlist on the website. We’re very specific with giving people things that they can do in their local communities to begin this process of building. But next year, we will have several mobilizations of people on a large scale. We need people to be involved in that. And we’ll also be doing these town halls in order to talk about real options. We’ll have experts and people who are demystifying this and trying to bring it down to Earth. No pun intended.\n", "9"));
        newsList.add(new News("Where Does All the Plastic Go?", "What happens to all the marine macroplastic—big stuff, like buckets, toys, bottles, toothbrushes, flip-flops—before it breaks down?", "Climate", "Every year, an estimated eight million metric tons of land-based plastic enters the world’s oceans. But when marine researchers have measured how much of this plastic is floating on the water’s surface, swirling in offshore gyres—most notably, the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch, between Hawaii and California—they have only found quantities on the order of hundreds of thousands of tons, or roughly one per cent of all the plastic that has ever gone into the ocean. Part of the explanation for this is that all plastic eventually breaks down into microplastic, and, although this takes some polymers decades, others break down almost immediately, or enter the ocean as microplastic already (like the synthetic fibres that pill off your fleece jacket or yoga pants in the washing machine). Scientists have recently found tiny pieces of plastic falling with the rain in the high mountains, including France’s Pyrenees and the Colorado Rockies. British researchers collected amphipods (shrimplike crustaceans) from six of the world’s deepest ocean trenches and found that eighty per cent of them had microplastic in their digestive tracts. These kinds of plastic fibres and fragments are smaller than poppy seeds and “the perfect size to enter the bottom of the food web,” as Jennifer Brandon, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told me. “They have been shown to be eaten by mussels, by coral, by sea cucumbers, by barnacles, by lots of filter-feeding plankton.”\n" +
                "But what happens to all the marine macroplastic—big stuff, like buckets, toys, bottles, toothbrushes, flip-flops—before it breaks down? Since most macroplastic has not been found floating at the surface, its location has, for many years, remained a mystery to scientists. “The question that everyone in the community has is, ‘Where is all the plastic?’ ” Erik van Sebille, an oceanographer who is leading a major five-year mapping project called TOPIOS, or Tracking of Plastic in Our Seas, told me. He calls the missing ninety-nine per cent “dark plastic.” It’s the dark matter of the sea.\n" +
                "Van Sebille has compared the problem to the discussion around carbon-dioxide emissions thirty years ago. Back then, scientists could see that people were adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but it was unclear where all the carbon dioxide was coming from. “We could only really start thinking about solutions once we got the carbon question closed,” he said. “How much was from aviation, or automobiles, or industry?” For dark plastic, the leading hypothesis has been that the majority of it sinks to the seafloor. Much of it might degrade quickly into microplastic and then sink; other pieces might sink and then quickly degrade, becoming part of that sedimentary record. And, of course, lots of junk gets eaten: it is likely that marine debris kills hundreds of thousands of sea birds, turtles, and marine mammals each year, though no one knows the exact number. In March, a Cuvier’s beaked whale, a species that can dive deeper and hold its breath longer than any other marine mammal, washed up dead in the Philippines with eighty-eight pounds of plastic in its body. In April, a sperm whale washed up dead in Italy with forty-eight pounds of plastic, as well as the remains of a fetus, in its body.\n" +
                "Scientists working for the nonprofit Dutch organization the Ocean Cleanup, which is attempting to create a giant autonomous rake to collect and remove trash floating on the high seas, published a study in the journal Scientific Reports last week that presents a new hypothesis. Based on data the group has collected in the field, it posits that only a small fraction of the plastic that has entered the ocean eventually arrives to one of the five great ocean gyres, where it might persist for decades. According to the study, most of the plastic thought to be currently in the marine environment—somewhere between seventy and a hundred and eighty-nine million metric tons—is stranded, lingering on shorelines and beaches, or buried near the coastline, deep under sand and rocks.\n" +
                "On various Ocean Cleanup expeditions across the Pacific, researchers had collected a good deal of decades-old trash from the surface. The age of the items was apparent because of their displayed production dates. The oldest item discovered was a plastic bottle crate from 1977. But, apart from debris resulting from the tsunami in Japan in 2011, researchers did not find much recently made plastic—items from the past decade, during which plastic production, and the resulting emissions, have been at their fastest and greatest rates. This was perplexing; if it was true that most plastic sinks and degrades, as the leading hypothesis put forth, then, statistically speaking, most of the plastic that the researchers found floating at the surface should be newer. “If everything was degrading very quickly, we would not find so many old objects,” Laurent Lebreton, the study’s lead author and the Ocean Cleanup’s lead oceanographer, told me by phone. “We should be finding more objects from 2010 and after. This, however, was not the case.”\n" +
                "Lebreton created what he describes as a very simple computer box model, which relies on five parameters, including the coastal stranding rate and plastic’s degradation rate, to better understand how different types of plastic move in the sea and why so much of the plastic they have found is so old. Lebreton and his co-authors, Matthias Egger and Boyan Slat, the founder of the Ocean Cleanup, wrote that, based on the model, it seems that land is likely “storing a major fraction of the missing plastic debris.” A small fraction of the plastic is “possibly slowly circulating between coastal environments with repeated episodes of beaching, fouling”—the accumulation of living and nonliving things on the materials’ surface—“defouling and resurfacing.” The older artifacts that the researchers had seen in the middle of the ocean were the few that had escaped the cycle, at least for a while. If they had not collected them, those artifacts might have also, one day, washed up again, on yet another beach.\n" +
                "Van Sebille, who was not involved in Lebreton’s study and has not worked for the Ocean Cleanup, applauded the study and the simplicity of Lebreton’s model, which made it easy and quick to use. “These kind of exploratory models are desperately needed in the field,” he said. His project, TOPIOS, is still a few years away from any definite conclusions. But, van Sebille said, the findings in Lebreton’s paper—that most of the missing plastic has landed near the shore—“is kind of what we are seeing in our models, too.” If Lebreton’s conclusion “is true, then that is very problematic,” he continued. Most marine life is near coastlines—fisheries, agriculture, coral reefs. “In the open ocean, sure there are organisms, but the biodiversity and economic value of that is far lower.” Plastic in the ocean is particularly harmful when near land, arguably even worse than if it was sinking into the depths somewhere offshore. “You could read this paper as an advocation for beach cleanups,” van Sebille said.\n" +
                "That is perhaps an ironic conclusion, considering that the Ocean Cleanup is an organization devoted to developing new multimillion-dollar technologies to clean trash floating at the surface of the high seas. Boyan Slat told me that the findings “go to show that prevention is also important. If you want to clean the coastal environment, you need to close the tap. The broader statement is that we need to do it all, which includes cleaning up plastic pollution in the environment, from garbage patches to the mountains.”\n" +
                "Although cleaning up all plastic once it enters the environment is likely impossible, the amount that can currently be cleaned up, as this study shows, is not insignificant. Last year, more than a million people, across 22,300 miles of shorelines and waterways around the world, participated in the Ocean Conservancy’s annual International Coastal Cleanup. They collected nearly a hundred million pieces of trash (23.3 million pounds), including a vacuum cleaner, a boom box, and dentures. The top item collected was, yet again, the measly cigarette butt (filters contain plastic), followed by food packaging, a $370 billion market in 2020. Policies that address the crisis at the source—by eliminating single-use plastics, expanding the circular economy (i.e., reusing more materials), and improving sanitation, waste, and recycling infrastructure, especially in developing nations—hold the most promise for reducing the amount of plastic in our seas. In the meantime, the old-fashioned beach cleanup never looked like such a worthwhile way to spend a morning. (This year’s International Coastal Cleanup will be held on Saturday, September 21st.)\n" +
                "Eventually, all of the plastic contamination ends up in the same place—documented deep in the mud. Jennifer Brandon, the Scripps oceanographer, led a recent study in which she and her co-authors analyzed a core of sediment that was excavated a mile offshore from Santa Barbara, California. The core dates from 1834 until 2009. They found that, since the nineteen-forties, the quantity of microplastic in each sediment layer began to increase exponentially, doubling every fifteen years. There is almost no oxygen at the bottom of the Santa Barbara basin where the core was drilled, nineteen hundred feet deep, so there are no animals to stir up sediment. When phytoplankton and other things fall from the surface to the seafloor, they are left undisturbed, forming perfect, annual layers, akin to tree rings or a glacier’s layers. And, just as trapped air bubbles in an ice core drilled from a glacier show the industrial revolution’s sudden and steady increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, the plastic fragments and fibres that dot this sedimentary core correlate to postwar increases in population and commercial plastic production. “Because plastic lasts forever in sediment, and the trends in plastic consumption so clearly match the trends of the Great Acceleration of the Anthropocene,” Brandon told me, “plastic is kind of the perfect geological marker of this new geological age.”\n", "8"));

                "The Trump administration agreed with Canada and Mexico on revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement one year ago, but the deal still needs the approval of Congress. A handshake agreement with the administration in the coming days would give the Democratic caucus a tangible accomplishment on an issue that has animated its base. It could also give Democrats a chance to lock in long-sought policy changes to a trade pact they criticize as prioritizing corporations over workers, laying the groundwork for future trade agreements.\n" +
                "Those factors have coaxed Democrats to the table at an improbable moment, when Washington is split by partisan fights and deeply divided over an impeachment inquiry. After months of talks, including through the Thanksgiving break, both sides say they’re in the final phase of negotiations. But Democrats insist the administration must make more changes to the labor, environmental and other provisions before Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California will bring legislation implementing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to a vote.\n" +
                "“By any standard, what we’ve already negotiated is substantially better than NAFTA,” said Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, who is heading the Democratic group negotiating with the administration. “Labor enforcement, in my judgment, is the last hurdle.”\n" +
                "The deal presents a dilemma for Democrats because it contains measures they have supported for years, from requiring more of a car’s parts to be made in North America to rolling back a special system of arbitration for corporations and strengthening Mexican labor unions.\n" +
                "In borrowing from the Democrats’ playbook, the revised pact reflects Mr. Trump’s populist trade approach — one that has blurred party lines and appealed to many of the blue-collar workers Democrats once counted among their base. It also reflects a broader backlash to more traditional free trade deals, which have been criticized for hollowing out American manufacturing and eliminating jobs.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“Taken as a whole, it looks more like an agreement that would’ve been negotiated under the Obama administration,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a former trade representative during the George W. Bush administration, who supports the pact. “There are some aspects to it that Democrats have been calling for, for decades.”\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In fact, it goes so far to the left of traditional Republican views on trade that some congressional Republicans only grudgingly support it — or may vote against the final deal. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, one of the most ardent Republican critics of the deal, has called the pact “a complete departure from the free trade agreements we’ve pursued through our history” and urged fellow Republicans to vote it down. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "“If we adopt this agreement, it will be the first time that I know of in the history of the Republic that we will agree to a new trade agreement that is designed to diminish trade,” Mr. Toomey said at a hearing in July, sitting next to a large red sign that said: “NAFTA > U.S.M.C.A.”\n" +
                "Still, most Republicans have supported the pact and urged rapid action. If the deal is not approved soon, proponents fear it could become the target of more frequent attacks by Democratic presidential candidates, making it even more difficult for Democrats in Congress to vote for the pact.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Mr. Trump has spent weeks accusing Ms. Pelosi of being “grossly incompetent” and prioritizing impeachment over a trade deal that could benefit workers. “She’s incapable of moving it,” Mr. Trump said last week, warning that a “great trade deal for the farmers, manufacturers, workers of all types, including unions” could fall apart if the Democrats don’t take action. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "While long demonized by Mr. Trump, Democrats and labor unions, NAFTA has become critical to companies and consumers across North America, guiding commerce around the continent for a quarter century. Entire industries have grown up around the trade agreement, which allows goods like cars, avocados and textiles to flow tariff free among Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "But Mr. Trump and other critics have blamed the deal for encouraging companies to move their factories to Mexico. The president has routinely called NAFTA the “worst trade deal ever made” and promised during his campaign that he would rewrite it in America’s favor — or scrap it altogether.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The revised pact took over a year of rancorous talks to complete, resulting in a complex 2,082-page agreement covering a wide range of topics. While much of it simply updates NAFTA for the 21st century, it also contains changes intended to encourage manufacturing in the United States, including by raising how much of a carmust be made in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The new agreement requires at least 70 percent of an automaker’s steel and aluminum to be bought in North America, which could help boost United States metal production. And 40 to 45 percent of a car’s content must be made by workers earning an average wage of $16 an hour. That $16 floor is an effort to force auto companies to either raise low wages in Mexico or hire more workers in the United States and Canada, an outcome Democrats have long supported.\n" +
                "It also rolls back a special system of arbitration for corporations that the Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has criticized as allowing companies to bypass the American legal system and Trump administration officials describe as an incentive for companies to send their factories abroad.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The pact also includes, at least on paper, provisions that aim to do away with sham Mexican labor unions that have done little to help workers by requiring every company in Mexico to seek worker approval of collective bargaining agreements by secret ballot in the next four years. \n" +
                "Some Democrats are skeptical that the Mexican government will allocate the necessary funds to ensure that companies are complying with these changes. But if the rules are enforced, Democrats say they may help stem the flow of jobs to Mexico and put American workers on a more equal footing. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Several sticking points remain, including a provision that offers an advanced class of drugs 10 years of protection from cheaper alternatives, which Democratic lawmakers say would lock in high drug prices. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "Other Democratic proposals aim to add teeth to the pact’s labor and environmental provisions. Democrats want to reverse a change made by the Trump administration that they say essentially guts NAFTA’s enforcement system. They are also arguing for additional resources that would allow customs officials to inspect factories or stop goods at the border if companies violate labor rules. \n" +

                "Ms. Pelosi, who has continued to suggest that she wants to “get to yes” on the deal, responded to Mr. Trump’s rebuke last week by saying that she needed to see the administration’s commitments in writing before moving forward. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The agreement still has skeptics, including labor leaders and others on the left.\n" +
                "“Unless Donald Trump agrees to add stronger labor and environmental standards and enforcement, and secures progress on labor reforms in Mexico, NAFTA job outsourcing will continue,” said Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch. “And the Big Pharma giveaways Trump added must go: They make U.S.M.C.A. worse than NAFTA.”\n" +
                "But Democrats say that if the additional changes they are seeking get made, the deal would be more progressive than the original NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership — both of which were negotiated by Democratic administrations. Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership within days of taking office.\n" +

                "At a private lunch on June 11 at the Capitol, Republican senators peppered Vice President Mike Pence with questions about why the administration was not lobbying Democrats harder to back the deal.

                "But while online reviews have become powerful sales tools, the ecosystem is relatively crude. Reviews can be easy to manipulate, and the operators of sites with the most reviews are not always motivated to crack down on fake ones planted to promote products. That leaves many consumers wondering what to believe. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "“The detection of it is a very difficult issue,” said Edward C. Malthouse, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University who has studied the influence of online reviews. “How can you tell if I’m just someone who’s being paid to write a review versus a genuine review?” \n" +

                "The state of the system was highlighted last month in a proposed settlement between Sunday Riley Skincare, a popular seller of items like $55 night oils and $85 brightening serums, and the Federal Trade Commission, which found that the company had posted fake reviews of its products on Sephora’s website for years. Allegations that the brand directed employees to write fake reviews emerged on Reddit last year, but the F.T.C. complaint was far more detailed and said the company’s chief executive, Sunday Riley, had been directly involved in the scheme.\n" +
                "The complaint included a July 2016 email from Ms. Riley that told employees to create three Sephora accounts each with different personas and Gmail addresses. In addition to posting praise, she wrote, employees should “dislike” negative reviews. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "“After enough dislikes, it is removed,” she added. “This directly translates to sales!!” \n" +

                "\n" +
                "The agency found multiple fake reviews between 2015 and 2017. When Sephora removed some of them, the F.T.C. said, Sunday Riley started to use technology that obscured locations and IP addresses. Interns were asked to post from fake Sephora accounts as recently as April 2018. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The F.T.C. complaint cited another email from a Sunday Riley employee offering tips: “If you notice someone saying things like I didn’t like ‘x’ about it, write a review that says the opposite. The power of reviews is mighty, people look to what others are saying to persuade them and answer potential questions they have.” \n" +

                "\n" +
                "Sephora still promotes Sunday Riley products in its stores. The retailer said in an email to The New York Times that it did “not believe the actions at Sunday Riley are representative of our brands or the countless hours our clients have spent sharing their authentic product experiences with us.” The company said it vetted and had removed certain Sunday Riley reviews from its website, particularly if reviews were left the same day the account was created.\n" +
                "Sephora has a new system for verifying the source of reviews and added badges to highlight reviews tied to purchases, the company said. It did not address questions about any punitive action it took against Sunday Riley. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "The response from Sephora and the proposed settlement with the F.T.C., which did not include a financial penalty, surprised some in the industry. The commission received roughly 40 comments about the agreement from frustrated consumers, one of whom said it was a “finger wag.” \n" +
                "\n" +
                "“It was the most blatant case of fake reviews, and this is how the government responds to it,” said Saoud Khalifah, chief executive of Fakespot, a company that analyzes the authenticity of reviews on sites like Amazon, Sephora and Best Buy. “Now everybody is like, O.K., if that’s the penalty, then why not write more fake reviews and pump ourselves through the roof?”\n" +
                "Two of the F.T.C.’s five commissioners, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, objected to the proposed settlement.

                "Sunday Riley would face the threat of civil penalties if it engaged in this behavior again. The company did not have to provide consumer redress, in part because it would be difficult to calculate how many purchases were driven by the fake reviews.\n" +
                "“An order that binds a company and its C.E.O. for 20 years, imposing reputational costs and subjecting Ms. Riley and her company to the threat of significant civil penalties, sends a strong signal to the market,” Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner, said in an email to The Times.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "E-commerce sellers, from legitimate brands to counterfeiters, can also buy good reviews through dodgy websites, online forums and Facebook groups. There are services that connect sellers with consumers who are willing to buy and rate products online for reimbursement. Positive ratings not only drive sales but can increase the odds that products appear high in search results.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "“The incentives are incredibly high for brands to create fake reviews or incentivize reviews,” said John LeBaron, Pattern’s chief revenue officer. “Many brands I’ve spoken with say: ‘I feel like if I don’t do this, then I’m not staying level with my competition, I’m literally just falling behind.’” \n" +
                "Volume can also make a big difference. The likelihood that consumers who read reviews will buy a product can triple based on the number of reviews it has, according to research by Mr. Malthouse, the Northwestern professor, and Yorgos Askalidis, a data scientist, in 2016. \n" +
                "Companies like Fakespot specialize in detecting fake or paid reviews, particularly those posted by humans. Their systems look at language patterns, account creation dates, the types of items that certain accounts are reviewing, and more. \n" +

                "An Amazon spokesman said in a statement that companies like Fakespot “simply do not have access to the information we have, and they wrongly accuse reviews from genuine customers who have worked hard to provide valuable feedback so that other shoppers can benefit.”\n" +
                "“That is not to suggest that there aren’t bad actors,” the spokesman added. “We are aware of bad actors that attempt to abuse our systems, and we continue to invest significant resources to protect the integrity of our reviews, and we will not stop working hard on behalf of our customers and selling partners.”\n" +

BuzzFeed News recently detailed how one woman had bought hundreds of cheaply made products on Amazon and given them five-star reviews in exchange for reimbursement from sellers, whom she often connected with through Facebook. Her fraudulent reviews, which are given credibility through the “verified purchase” label and can include photos and videos, have gone undetected by Amazon, BuzzFeed reported.\n" +

He advised sorting reviews by “most recent,” which can help illuminate any issues. He also said he tended to ask family and friends about products and checked with independent resources like Consumer Reports. \n" +

The new rule, reported earlier today by Reuters, bans the publishing of false information or deepfakes online without proper disclosure that the post in question was created with AI or VR technology. Failure to disclose this is now a criminal offense, the Chinese government says.\n" +
                "The rules go into effect on January 1st, 2020, and will be enforced by the Cyberspace Administration of China. “With the adoption of new technologies, such as deepfake, in online video and audio industries, there have been risks in using such content to disrupt social order and violate people’s interests, creating political risks and bringing a negative impact to national security and social stability,” the CAC said in a notice to online video hosting websites on Friday, according to the South China Morning Post.\n" +

                "Last month, California became the first US state to criminalize the use of deepfakes in political campaign promotion and advertising. The law, called AB 730 and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, makes it a crime to publish audio, imagery, or video that gives a false, damaging impression of a politician’s words or actions. California’s law does not use the word deepfake, but it’s clear the AI-manufactured fakes are the primary culprit, along with videos misleadingly edited to frame someone in a negative light.\n" +
                "California’s approach does exclude news media, as well as parody and satire, with the sole aim for now being to prevent the potential damage that deepfake attack ads could cause when used in the run-up to an election. The law applies to candidates within 60 days of an election and it’s designed to expire by 2023 unless explicitly reenacted.\n" +
                "Congress is also in the process of analyzing the potential harm of deepfakes and how best to combat their influence in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. The House Intelligence Committee held a hearing on the subject after convening a panel of experts from universities and think tanks to come up with a deepfake strategy with regard to election integrity and security. There are also numerous pieces of legislation moving through Congress at the moment that would require special watermarks over or disclosures around fake or misleading media, as well as criminalization of the creation and distribution of such video.\n" +
                "On the US platform side, Facebook and Twitter are in the process of creating better tools for detecting deepfakes and helping reduce the spread of those videos and imagery across the respective platforms.

        newsList.add(new News("Elizabeth Warren's Plan to Break Up Big Tech", "Warren released a plan that aims to reverse what is now a nearly four-decade trend in the concentration of corporate power in the U.S. economy.", "Tech", "When Robert Bork published “The Antitrust Paradox,” in 1978, concerns about monopolies suppressing competition were not new. The first U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed in 1890; during the early years of the twentieth century, President Theodore Roosevelt used the law to break up Standard Oil and to apply new regulations to the dominant railroad companies. In 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Act, which granted powers to the Department of Justice and the newly created Federal Trade Commission to insure companies did not become too dominant in the first place. President Franklin Roosevelt and other New Deal policymakers continued the tradition of aggressive antitrust enforcement. But Bork, a professor at Yale Law School and later a nominee for the Supreme Court, argued that many of these antitrust measures had been unnecessary. When deciding whether a particular enterprise posed an antitrust threat, he wrote, the government should only take action in cases where concentration of power in the market harmed consumers in the form of higher prices. In the decade after Bork published his influential treatise, there was a boom in corporate mergers as airlines, energy companies, pharmaceutical firms, and media conglomerates acquired their competitors; as long as it could plausibly be argued that the prices consumers paid for products wouldn’t rise, regulators generally allowed the deals to proceed.\n" +
                "Bork’s consumer-based theory had many flaws. One of the most obvious was that it did not anticipate the rise of online companies such as Facebook and Google, which offer their products to consumers for free. The companies make money by monitoring their customers’ online activity and selling the data, largely to advertisers. As long as the official cost to consumers to use the platforms remained the same—around zero—the giant tech firms argued that their increasing size and influence over every aspect of online life posed no antitrust threat.\n" +
                "In March, Senator Elizabeth Warren released a plan that aims to reverse what is now a nearly four-decade trend in the concentration of corporate power in the U.S. economy. The proposal, which was released as part of Warren’s campaign for President, would both break up the major technology companies and regulate them more heavily. Central to her argument is the idea that, though consolidation might not have raised prices for certain online services, it has helped depress wages, inflate executive pay, and stifle the rise of new businesses. This, in turn, has contributed to the decline of middle-class financial security and the rise of income and wealth inequality. “Left unchecked, concentration will destroy innovation,” Warren has said. “Left unchecked, concentration will destroy more small companies and startups. Left unchecked, concentration will suck the last vestiges of economic security out of the middle class.”\n" +
                "As a law professor, antitrust was not Warren’s expertise; rather, her background as an academic was in bankruptcy and consumer debt, and how those issues created rising economic insecurity for the middle class. In the years following the financial crisis, though, the two subjects seemed increasingly connected. Market consolidation reduced consumer choice, as Bork had argued, but it also led to job losses and wage stagnation as employees and small businesses had less and less power when faced with giant competitors. In particular, monopolies and oligopolies (when a few large competitors control a market) helped explain one of the biggest mysteries of the current economy: why low unemployment had not led to commensurately higher wages.\n" +
                "In early 2016, one of Warren’s advisers reached out to a Yale law student named Lina Khan. Khan had worked for Open Markets, a think tank at the New America Foundation, in Washington, D.C., studying antitrust in different industries, including agriculture and airlines. She was among a handful of legal scholars and journalists who have been trying to sound the alarm about rising monopolies for several years. In Warren, Khan and the head of Open Markets, Barry Lynn, found a high-profile figure in Washington who was willing to listen and who had the ability to draw attention to the cause. They met for dinner, where Khan and Lynn talked through their views with Warren, mainly that certain market-dominating conglomerates were abusing their power and undermining the country’s economic health. They suggested several anti-monopoly tools, including breaking up some of these giant companies.\n" +
                "On June 29, 2016, Warren delivered a speech, titled “Reigniting Competition in the American Economy,” at an event for Open Markets. She began the talk with a few lines about her academic research related to the functioning of competitive markets. “I love markets!” Warren said. “Strong, healthy markets are a key to a strong, healthy America.” But, she went on, competition in America is declining. In the financial sector, already large banks had become even bigger, increasing the likelihood of excessive risk-taking; four major airlines control eighty per cent of all domestic airplane seats; a few health-care conglomerates comprise the vast majority of the health-insurance market; and three pharmacy chains represent ninety-nine per cent of the nation’s drug stores. She then held up some of the country’s largest technology firms for their own critique: the largest tech companies controlled online platforms that other businesses depend on to survive, making it nearly impossible for others to fairly compete. “Google, Apple, and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and every day they deliver enormous value,” she said. “They deserve to be highly profitable and highly successful. But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors who want their chance to change the world.”\n" +
                "In “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” published in the Yale Law Journal, in January, 2017, Khan made a similar argument that the old antitrust paradigms were outdated in the Internet era. Amazon, in particular, had become so large that it was influencing the economy in all sorts of unseen ways. Amazon had access to unprecedented amounts of data, both about consumers and also other retailers using its platform. This, Khan argued, gave the company an unfair advantage because it essentially had access to its competitors’ operating information. Approximately fifty per cent of all online sales now take place on Amazon, making it nearly impossible for independent retailers to avoid the site if they want to be viable. Furthermore, Khan continued, Amazon was willing to offer its products below the cost of delivering them and therefore operate with years of losses, giving it a potentially unfair incentive to engage in “predatory pricing.” “Through this strategy, the company has positioned itself at the center of e-commerce and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it,” Khan wrote. “Elements of the firm’s structure and conduct pose anticompetitive concerns—yet it has escaped antitrust scrutiny.”\n" +
                "The Amazon example has since become a recurring feature of Warren’s campaign speeches. She notes that, like most everyone else, she uses Amazon. At a town hall in April, Warren recalled that the last thing she’d purchased on the site was a new mailbox for her house. Still, her plan to break up Big Tech reflects a growing awareness of the drawbacks of decades of relaxed antitrust enforcement, even if certain activities such as shopping for housewares has become easier for consumers. The plan she released consists of several parts. Companies with revenue of twenty-five billion dollars or more that provide an online marketplace would be designated as “platform utilities” and would not be allowed to both own the marketplace and participate on it. Right from the start, Warren says, Amazon would have to separate its “Basics” business, which sells products under a house brand, from the rest of Amazon, and Google’s advertising business and its search business would have to be split apart. Secondly, she pledged to “empower” federal regulators to undo many of the tech-industry mergers that have already happened, such as Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods and Zappos; Facebook’s takeover of Whatsapp and Instagram; and Google’s purchase of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker have introduced legislation to address the problem; on July 23rd, the Justice Department announced that it was conducting a wide-ranging investigation into the “market-leading online platforms,” which are widely believed to include Google, Facebook, and Amazon.\n" +
                "Not long after Warren’s declaration of war on Silicon Valley, several tech executives issued public protests. Tim Cook, in a CNBC interview, said that Apple wasn’t a monopoly and objected to being lumped in with Google and Facebook; other critics suggested that the Warren plan was too vague and would be difficult to implement. In August, 2017, around a year after Warren’s New America speech, the Open Markets Institute was ousted from the New America Foundation, reportedly after the former Google C.E.O. Eric Schmidt—one of the Foundation’s major funders—complained about an article that the Institute had published in support of sanctions that the European Union had levied against Google for antitrust violations. (New America’s president, Anne-Marie Slaughter, publicly denied that this was the reason Open Markets was asked to leave; the think tank has since been reëstablished independently).\n" +
                "According to Sandeep Vaheesan, the legal director at the Open Markets Institute, the kinds of reforms Warren is proposing aren’t as radical as they sound. The weakening of the old system, he said, had been “a bipartisan project,” and people are once again starting to realize that the way the government and the public look at giant corporations needs to change. “I think the 2008 crisis led to a critical reëvaluation of the structure of our economy, and to the law and politics that have given rise to our current system,” he said. He also cited the publication of Thomas Picketty’s book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” from 2013, which had drawn significant attention to income and wealth inequality; the Occupy Wall Street movement; and the campaign for net neutrality as factors that roused public attention. Warren’s plan, he added, involved reversing merger transactions that are only a few years old. “I think that her ideas would really challenge the core model of these Big Tech companies,” he said. “It would force them to behave in more socially responsible ways.”\n", "10"));

First, the idea of cyberspace, a transnational, individualistic, largely unregulated, and free place that was not exactly located in any governmental domain, has completely collapsed. Second, the mythology of tech as the carrier of progress has imploded, just as it did for the robber barons of the late 19th century, ushering in the trust-busting era.

                "Angry Conservatives: The biggest change, of course, came with the 2016 campaign and the ultimate election of Donald Trump. Though Trump played the social-media game with tremendous success, conservatives criticized the platforms during the campaign and have continued to do so throughout the past two and a half years. Most recently, the president announced that he is collecting reports of social-media grievances. There has been a steady drumbeat over the same time frame of stories about tech companies’ left-leaning workforces, which conservatives have spun into a fable about how they are being suppressed. The evidence is thin, but it seems plausible to most people who believe that the platforms censor political viewpoints.\n" +
                "Disillusioned Liberal Tech Luminaries: Alongside the conservative-outrage machine, the biggest body blows that the tech industry has taken have come from disillusioned liberals who worked for those companies. While their specific critiques vary, most of them feel that the platforms aided and abetted the election of President Trump—that is to say, roughly the opposite of the conservative critique above. Many have come to expand their criticisms to the basic mechanisms of the technology industry, from the former Googler Tristan Harris, who works on “Time Well Spent,” to the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who has called for the government to break up the company.\n" +
                "Antitrust Theoreticians: The version of antitrust regulations that emerged in the 20th century held that consumer prices had to rise in order for monopolistic conditions to cause harm. That framing protected Big Tech companies such as Google and Facebook, which give away their products to users. How can there be consumer harm if consumers are paying $0.00? But a new wave of antitrust scholars, now centered at the Open Markets Institute, has argued that this view is outdated because free services can still be harmful to societies. It’s opened the door to new attacks on the market power of Big Tech, and it’s already gained adherents.\n" +
                "Democratic Presidential Candidates: Headlined by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democratic presidential contenders have proved ready to tussle with Big Tech. Drawing on the new antitrust doctrine, Warren has argued for breaking up the Big Tech firms “to restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last.”\n" +
                "Rank-and-File Tech Workers: For years and years, tech companies very rarely leaked. Workers were generally pretty happy, and corporate cultures discouraged talking with outsiders. That’s changed. Now all kinds of tech workers with different agendas—from James Damore types to anti-sexual-harassment campaigners to union organizers—have begun to talk with the press, publicly or privately. The pressure has led to important internal reforms, but has also opened the companies up to new political attacks from a range of directions. All the leaks have eroded the sense of impenetrability that used to surround operations such as Google.\n" +
                "Traditional Democratic Corporate Reformers: Reining in corporate power has long been part of most Democratic politicians’ agenda. But now that zeal is often directed not just at Wall Street or automakers, but also at tech companies. In his position as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey has repeatedly battled tech-company executives who have testified before him. He’s a traditional Democratic establishment force, an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and clearly sees the tech industry as the kind of corporate power that needs to be reined in, starting perhaps with new privacy regulations. “We’ve been talking about it for years, yet nothing has been done to address the problem,” Pallone said at a February hearing. “It’s time that we move past the old model that protects the companies using our data and not the people.”\n" +
                "Privacy Advocates: It would be hard to argue that privacy advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation have had too big of an impact on tech companies, even after the Edward Snowden revelations gave them far more ammunition than they had in years past. Just look around at the data every person on Earth seems to be leaking. The activists remain in the background, pushing for reforms and calling out tech-industry lobbying. Their political alignments might prove difficult to pin down, however, as more muscular government involvement runs counter to the foundational principles of most early internet-privacy proponents.\n" +
                "European Regulators: Nobody has been harder on Big Tech than European regulators, who caused quite a ruckus with their General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, the jury is still out on what the ultimate impact of the GDPR might be on tech firms and everyday users. Europeans have more control, but Big Tech companies might be the real winners (something tech companies have been whispering about many regulations). That said, it’s hard to imagine that the Europeans are done battling American tech companies’ dominance in their lives.\n" +
                "The Media Industry: Having had its lunch eaten, its lunch money taken, and its person shoved into a toilet and a locker by Big Tech, the media industry has begun to fight back. Across the board, the longtime frenemy relationship that most publishers tried to maintain with the Big Tech companies has soured. One thing to watch: With the Facebook wave receding and Google solidifying its control over traffic, the media industry might start to find some love in its heart for Google, while maintaining its open season on Facebook.\n" +
                "The Telecom Industry: Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T might not be the most popular companies in the world, but the old-line telecoms know that Big Tech is their most important competitor. After years of losing regulatory battles, they’ve begun to claw their way back. With the banner of mobile innovation now passing to 5G, it wouldn’t be shocking to see them ramp up their efforts against the platforms that use their networks.\n" +
                "Scholarly Tech Critics: The technology industry has long had skeptics in the academy, but over the past five years, those researchers have landed many more blows, from many different angles. They’ve exploded myths, coined new language for problems, and created rallying cries for those inside and outside the industry. Cataloging them all would be impossible, but this sample gets at the breadth of the critiques: Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism; Evgeny Morozov’s To Save Everything, Click Here; Zeynep Tufekci in The New York Times; Tim Wu’s The Attention Merchants; Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction; Siva Vaidhyanathan’s anti-paeans to Google and Facebook; Frank Pasquale’s The Black Box Society; Safiya Umoja Noble’s Algorithms of Oppression; Sherry Turkle’s Reclaiming Conversation; Malkia Cyril’s powerful essays; and Jean Twenge’s alarming work on youths and their relationship to technology.\n" +
                "Apple: Of the Big Tech companies, Apple is the one that has the most at stake in the regulatory battles. On the one hand, it needs the other giants to produce the apps that make an iPhone worth buying. On the other hand, anything that reduces its perceived value—such as, perhaps, corporate or government surveillance—is bad. Apple can take the moral high ground in some ways because it doesn’t use data in the same way as surveillance-capitalism companies such as Google and Facebook, as Zuboff points out. And it has now taken to highlighting its more privacy-protective approaches and building new ones, which calls attention to the mountains of data its rivals use more intensively.\n" +
                "Oracle and Other Business-Software Companies: Oracle has long been a Google enemy, in part because Google gives away the kinds of products that Oracle sells to big companies and governments.

The company has helped fund a particularly hard-hitting and effective operation called the Google Transparency Project out of the Campaign for Accountability, which has traditionally gone after Republicans for ethical violations.* The Transparency Project, which is funded by Oracle and other Google rivals, drew massive attention to Google’s remarkable funding of scholars and academics.\n" +

The two have been on the road together navigating the globe-trotting World Cup circuit since 2012 when Mikaela became a regular on the tour as a 16-year-old. Mikaela won the first of her 61 World Cup races that season and is now the three-time defending World Cup overall champion, seemingly on her way to shattering every Alpine racing record.\n" +
                "“People have asked me, ‘What’s your secret?’ Well, it’s my mom. Isn’t it obvious?” Mikaela said on Friday. “She was the advantage I had that no one else had, and she gave me that edge over everyone else. But I felt like I couldn’t ask her to do it anymore.”\n" +
                "Both Shiffrins referred to the change as a transition, and Mikaela said that she was especially relieved when she won a slalom last weekend in Levi, Finland, without her mother there to coach her on the hill.\n" +
                "“It was a big relief because that’s the first World Cup or Olympic or world championship win that she has not been at,” Mikaela said. “It was a test, and I obviously had a good race and was able to do what I needed to do to stay focused.\n" +
                "“And even if she’s not here with me every step of the way, we’re still FaceTiming every night and talking about skiing. It’s just different.”\n" +
                "Eileen, who expects to visit Mikaela during some European races next month, predicted that the “ups and downs” of the new arrangement would lead to “Mikaela coming out stronger on the other side of this.”\n" +
                "Mikaela agreed.\n" +
                "“I wouldn’t judge things based on wins but more on how I learn to do some of these things for myself, which is also very important,” she said. “It’s going to be a process.”\n" +
                "On Saturday, Eileen watched the giant slalom race at the Killington resort from the stands with her husband. The race had been considered a rematch of the season-opener in Austria, when Alice Robinson, a 17-year-old from New Zealand, earned an upset victory over Shiffrin. But Marta Bassino of Italy won this time; Robinson slid off the racecourse early on Saturday with about 10 gates remaining.\n" +
                "At a post-race news conference, Shiffrin smiled and said: “I enjoyed today. And I’m really looking forward to tomorrow.”\n" +

        newsList.add(new News("14-Year-Old Skateboarder Enters a New World", "International Olympic Committee announced in 2016 that skateboarding would make its debut at the 2020 Summer Games", "Sports", "Kendra Long, an elite skateboarder who recently celebrated her 14th birthday, does a lot of fancy tricks at the small skateboard park that lives in her family’s driveway in this rural patch of southeast Texas. There arevarials, board slides, fakie full cab flips. Kendra is 5-foot-6, with long blonde hair that swirls around her face when she twists and drifts and spins and soars. The neighbors’ horses sometimes amble up to the fence to watch.\n" +
                "Not so long ago, Kendra had ambitions that mirrored those of the typical budding competitor in extreme sports: Add to her portfolio of skills and improve enough to compete in some events, maybe at the X Games or on the Dew Tour.\n" +
                "But the calculus changed for Kendra and many of her peers when the International Olympic Committee announced in 2016 that skateboarding would make its debut at the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo. Not only that, there would be no minimum age requirement — as there is in gymnastics, for example. The decision opened the door for even preteens to potentially compete on the sports world’s biggest stage. \n" +
                "While adult athletes tend to dominate men’s skateboarding, a cluster of girls have been excelling on the women’s side. The I.O.C.’s decision instantly altered many of their lives. Young athletes like Kendra are now hopscotching the globe for qualifying competitions and, in the best of circumstances, getting their families to finance an expensive dream.\n" +
                "“I was just doing it for fun,” she said recently. “And I’m still doing it for fun. But it does feel more serious now.”\n" +
                "She is not alone. There is no buzzier skateboarder on the planet at the moment than Rayssa Leal, an 11-year-old from Brazil who rose to prominence after videos of her doing tricks in a tutu went viral online. She now has a cluster of sponsors, more than 480,000 followers on Instagram and medal aspirations for Tokyo.\n" +
                "“She’s so good,” Kendra Long said.\n" +
                "In July, at an elite event in Los Angeles, Rayssa and Kendra competed alongside far more experienced pros like Alexis Sablone, a 33-year-old Barnard graduate who has helped design her own shoe for Converse, and Annie Guglia, a 29-year-old Canadian who came out of retirement when she learned that skateboarding would be in the Olympics.\n" +
                "Rayssa was so small by comparison that it looked as if she were riding a surfboard. But she whizzed around the course, flipping her board with flair. She finished to a standing ovation and was hugging her first-place trophy when officials sent her to doping control. \n" +
                "Kendra, who placed 10th, was a few weeks from entering the eighth grade.\n" +
                "“This young generation is going to push women’s skateboarding so much further than we’ve seen,” Guglia said. “It actually makes me proud to say, ‘Yeah, an 11-year-old beat me.’”\n" +
                "The Olympics will include two types of skateboarding events: street skateboarding, in which tricks are executed on a variety of apparatus, like ledges and rails, and park skateboarding, whichusesa huge hollowed-out bowl for aerial maneuvers.\n" +
                "A few months ago, at the Park Skateboarding World Championships in São Paulo, Brazil, the youth movement was on full display. Misugu Okamoto, 13, of Japan, won the title, while Sky Brown, an 11-year-old Olympic hopeful for Britain, finished third.\n" +
                "Some have suggested that smaller (and, often by extension, younger) skateboarders have an advantage because of a low center of mass, which might make it easier for them to stay on the board or to twist and turn through the air. But Yung Tae Kim, a physicist who has studied the science of skateboarding, dismissed that theory in a telephone interview.\n" +
                "“I think skaters are just starting younger,” said Kim, who noted that Tony Hawk, one of the greatest skateboarders ever, is 6-foot-3. “I think you’re seeing a lot of parents who are getting their kids on skateboards when they’re 2 or 3. And it turns out that when you do that, you can get really, really good — really, really fast.”\n" +
                "Kendra ranks 30th in the world and seventh among Americans in street skateboarding, according to the latest Olympic qualifying rankings. Only three Americans in her event will go to Tokyo, yet the mere prospect of the Olympics freaks her out. She sees a gap between herself and the best in the world. In her mind, the 2024 Summer Games in Paris are a more realistic goal. \n" +
                "“Oh, it’s too soon,” she said. “I need to learn more stuff. I want to get really good.”\n" +
                "She still has time. Qualifying events are scheduled through May, with point totals determining the selections for the American squad. \n" +
                "Kendra also has supportive parents who recognize that she has uncommon opportunities.\n" +
                "“I don’t think she wants to acknowledge that she has a chance,” said Donald Long, who works in the health care industry. “It would be too much pressure.”\n" +
                "Her mother, Natalie, says Kendra is a perfectionist.\n" +
                "“If she lands a trick and her foot isn’t quite right, she’ll say, ‘That was trash.’ And she’ll do it again,” said Natalie Long, who works as a dietitian.\n" +
                "The whole endeavor is surreal for the Longs: the travel, the possibilities, the odd talent that their daughter came to possess. Vidor, a small city of rolling pastures and stifling humiditythat was hit hard by flooding in September, is not a skateboarding hotbed.\n" +
                "“When I used to tell people that I skated, they’d be like, ‘Oh, you Rollerblade?’” Kendra said.\n" +
                "Her curious journey began about seven years ago when her father spent $5 on a used Santa Cruz skateboard at a thrift shop. The board reminded him of the ones he used to ride as a boy growing up outside Houston. He figured his two young sons might take an interest. Instead, it was his 6-year-old daughter who hopped on and refused to get off.\n" +
                "At the time, Kendra was a freshly minted second-degree black belt in karate with energy to burn. (Her nickname in karate was “The Machine.”) Her mother had considered putting her in gymnastics, but Kendra quickly gravitated to skateboarding. It took her about a month to learn how to Ollie, doing a hands-free hop on the board. Before long, she tackled more advanced tricks by studying clips online. She eventually began to enter contests in Texas — and did well, often against older boys.\n" +
                "She entered her first international competition in September 2018, at the Empire Open in Montreal, and placed fourth over all. She was 12. The result landed her on the world tour for Street League Skateboarding, which puts on many of the events that serve as Olympic qualifiers.\n" +
                "“She’s still super young, obviously,” Josh Friedberg, the chief executive officer for U.S.A. Skateboarding, said of Kendra in a telephone interview. “But with Paris on the horizon after Tokyo, there’s the chance of a real decades-long story for her.”\n" +
                "Yet the Olympics come with their own set of challenges and costs, especially for the emerging members of skateboarding’s upper crust. For Kendra and her family, that has meant roving the globe for competitions: to London, Rio de Janeiro, Los Angeles (three times).\n" +
                "Kendra now has sponsors like Nike Skateboarding, which sends her a fresh batch of sneakers every three months, and Autonomy, which supplies her boards. But she does not receive endorsement money — not yet, anyway — leaving her parents to foot the bill. Her trips to competitions cost between $4,000 and $8,000.\n" +
                "“The Olympic dream is not free!” Natalie Long said.\n" +
                "A few months ago, Kendra went with her mother to China for the International Skateboarding Open, which was not a career highlight. After crashing in training, she returned home with a busted thumb. She had been planning to compete at another event in Brazil, but she was exhausted and pulled out at the behest of her parents. She rebounded in October by placing fifth at the national championships. The next few months are important. Kendra said she was already looking ahead to competitions in Australia and China (again).\n" +
                "“We want her to be in tiptop shape,” Donald Long said.\n" +
                "Even as Kendra pursues lofty goals, her parents say they want to strike a balance. It bothers her mother, for example, that Kendra missed 41 days of school last year. \n" +
                "“I don’t want her to regret missing Friday night football games or hanging out with friends,” Natalie Long said. “I don’t want her to resent skateboarding. It has to stay fun.”\n" +
                "So Kendra supplements her life on four wheels by running cross-country and track, with her sights set on breaking Vidor Junior High School’s record in the mile this spring. She is the president of her school’s chapter of National Junior Honor Society. She throws an ugly sweater party for her friends at Christmas. She loves Netflix.\n" +
                "And even when she skates, there are unmistakable signs of youth: The grip tape on a board that she used at a recent competition featured Patrick, the chubby starfish from “SpongeBob SquarePants.”\n" +
                "But while skateboarding is not always her priority, she sometimes probably wishes it were. As the sun set the day after she returned from China, she came to a sad realization.\n" +

The Castro Theatre was packed, but neither Honnold nor Caldwell was there.\n" +
                "Instead, two other climbers prominently featured in the film, “The Nose Speed Record” — “little-known climbers Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds,” the promotional material called them — came from Yosemite National Park and charmed the audience.\n" +
                "Gobright, who died Wednesday after a fall during a descent in Mexico, was a self-described dirtbag, the fading term of endearment for climbers who live simply, and raggedly, for the single pursuit of climbing. (The climber Cedar Wright has lamented the slow extinction of “dirtbagging” in an age of climbing gyms.) Gobright was part of the furniture in Yosemite National Park, a friend to all the climbers but invisible to the millions of visitors.\n" +
                "James Lucas, a Yosemite veteran and an editor for Climbing magazine, recounted seeing Gobright a couple of weeks ago at the park’s Ahwahnee Hotel. Just a short walk from the places where Gobright lived in his Honda Civic, the Ahwahnee has rooms that cost several hundred dollars a night. Gobright once worked there. Now he was milling in the lobby among the loafered tourists.\n" +
                "“What are you doing here?” Lucas, in an Instagram post, recalled asking Gobright that day.\n" +
                "“I’m just waiting another hour,” Gobright said with a smile. “That’s when they start serving free cookies.”\n" +
                "It was Gobright’s and Reynolds’s 2017 speed record up the Nose of El Capitan that Honnold and Caldwell had tried to beat. And while the movie centers on the two well-sponsored superstars of the climbing world, it was Gobright and Reynolds who stole the show, in the film and in the theater, with their irreverence, daring and self-deprecation.\n" +
                "Honnold and Caldwell spent months trying to figure out how to shave seconds and minutes from the mark of just under 2 hours 20 minutes up 3,000 vertical feet. And even Honnold, known worldwide for his rope-free ascent of El Capitan from the Oscar-winning documentary, “Free Solo,” thought some of what Gobright did to race to the top was “sketchy.”\n" +
                "“Yeah, it’s sketchy,” Gobright said in the film, with a teasing smirk. “But that’s why I’ve got the record and you don’t.”\n" +
                "It’s a good-natured laugh line, fraught with undertone. Climbing’s continual balancing act, between safety and daring, freedom and caution, has been injected with a growing quest for speed.\n" +
                "Gobright was part of that. Honnold is, too. Even Caldwell, best known for his methodical 2015 Dawn Wall climb up El Capitan with Kevin Jorgeson, has been lured in.\n" +
                "So there was some irony that when Gobright, 31, died while climbing in Mexico, he was not racing up a difficult pitch, but rappelling down one with a partner. He apparently slid off the end of his unknotted rope and fell to his death.\n" +
                "It was a strange and fatal oversight, one that demonstrated, again, how quickly life can be snuffed out even when — especially when, maybe — it is least expected.\n" +
                "“He was such a warm, kind soul — one of a handful of partners that I always loved spending a day with,” Honnold wrote on Instagram, where he has 1.8 million followers. (Gobright had 57,000.) “I suppose there’s something to be said about being safe out there and the inherent risks of climbing but I don’t really care about that right now. I’m just sad for Brad and his family.”\n" +
                "I met Gobright before the San Francisco premiere last month. He was gregarious and polite. He seemed a bit bemused to be taking a star turn, but treated it like his latest, fleeting adventure. (Spoiler alert: Honnold and Caldwell shattered the record.)\n" +
                "When I heard the news of Gobright’s death on Thursday, I quickly recalled a similar climbing-documentary premiere in San Francisco five years before. I met Dean Potter that night. He was an eccentric, charismatic Yosemite climber and raconteur who had crept into mainstream consciousness. He died in a wingsuit accident in Yosemite a few months later.\n" +
                "And I thought of earlier this week, when the climber Emily Harrington fell on El Capitan and had to be rescued — by Honnold, of all people, among others. I received an email the next day from a public-relations firm asking if I’d like to write about Harrington’s misadventure. They had footage and could get me interviews. I declined.\n" +
                "Every climber falls; the question is how far. And every accomplished climber knows people who have died climbing. It is part of the culture.\n" +
                "Gobright certainly had lost friends and knew the dangers as well as anyone. He was even featured in a short film in 2017 called “Safety Third.” But climbers trust their experience and instincts, which is why Gobright’s romp up The Nose in 2017 included an upper stretch where he raced up without the safety of ropes. He used the bolts embedded in the rock like vertical monkey bars.\n" +
                "That was the sketchy part that even Honnold questioned. That was why Gobright’s death, coming down with a rope, not going up without one, was so shocking to the climbing world.\n" +
                "You could tell by Gobright’s aw-shucks turn during a post-film question-and-answer session in San Francisco last month that the kind of attention afforded the likes of Honnold and Caldwell was a foreign concept to him. \n" +
                "They were greeted with a standing ovation, but he and Reynolds were like an unpolished comedy act. They laughed at the casting, proud foils to the famous.\n" +
